# HP-BRMT

sturdy-guacamole?

That's the name Github suggested for the new repo when I created it. 

# I don't mean any copyright infingement or anything. I swear.

HP if any of this is uncool then please let me know. Also maybe look at the code, and if you like what I've done I'd be happy to come work for you. 

# Installation

Run setup.exe. It will handle all of the necessary setup necessary. 

actually idk if it's gonna be like "installed" or just existing. TBD.

# Tips

Make sure you know enough about the regular HP BIOS. This interface is designed to kind of mirror that, so hopefully it should be pretty clear whats going on.
